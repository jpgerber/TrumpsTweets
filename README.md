#TrumpsTweets NLP

This project explores the viability of making an automatic personality assessment via Tweets. The main challenge faced is extracting automatic data sets via NLP techniques. </br>
The resulting datasets will be imported into the results module from my dynamic-personality-test repo. The analysis uses a module implementing Kelly's personal construct theory of personality.</br>
The project is explicitly non-partisan, President Trump was chosen due to a large corpus of tweets. President Obama will be the second test subject.
